title: My Experience Learning Web Development Online
---

A year into a Ph.D. in Chemistry I began to realise a career in academia wasn't agreeing with me. When thinking about how best to point my life in a new direction my mind naturally wandered to going back through University. Courses I considered varied from Aerospace Engineering to Education UX design. After a bit of introspection (but not before secretly travelling to Brussels by Megabus to sit the GRE exam) I realised I didn't have the patience to sit through 4-5 years of lectures.

Luckily thanks to a [Lifehacker post on the Codecademy Year of Code](http://lifehacker.com/5872682/learn-to-code-in-2012-with-free-weekly-programming-lessons-from-codecademy) I realised I was more than capable of teaching myself new skills and that I enjoyed messing around with programming to [tweet Samuel L. Jackson monologues without much effort on my part](https://github.com/ddmck/StoryTweeter). My main worries were based on my reputation being damaged by quitting my Ph.D. and the chances of getting hired for a job in a field that I had no qualifications in. Eventually the stress of being unhappy in my current career and descision fagtigue from my inability to find the path to fulfullment in life led to me leaving my position in Amsterdam and returning to Edinburgh to recover.

From then on I scoured the internet for free resources to teach myself the foundation of web development with the aim to build the startups I had been dreaming up. Here are the list of those that I found the most useful:

## Great for finding your footing

### [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com)

As an early user of Codecademy I enjoyed being on and adventure to learn to program but the journey was quite disjointed. I didn't quite understand the usefulness of the Javascript lessons the launched with. I drifted off the "one tutorial a week" path at around week 8 and didn't return until the HTML and CSS lessons had launched. The visual feedback that each extra peice of knowledge of CSS I gained was giving my ideas a more refined look really gave me the hunger to keep digging deeper. The Python track allowed me to get away with using the service during the working hours of my Ph.D. as I would use it to automate data entry and handling. 

Everything still appeared to be static though. When the Ruby track launched and I found out that it was the key ingredient in the preferred web framework of startups I hurried my way through the lessons (Ruby's similarity to Python helped a great deal). Ruby on Rails was never taught but atleast I knew where to go next.

The API projects are also a great deal of fun and lead to a lot more experimentation. Breaking the rules of Twitter or ordering Sushi from the command line felt empowering. 

### [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/?vip=true)

Disclaimer: I found Dash after the period of time I spent learning Web-dev but I ran throught the classes and I have recommended it to others with positive results.

Dash provides a very visual introduction to HTML, CSS and Javascript. Lessons are longer than the typical Codecademy tutorial and play out like interactive powerpoint presentations. Style is much more of a focus, the quality of the finished tutorials (a mock blog and resturant site) look like something a relative might try to coerce you into building them for free.
